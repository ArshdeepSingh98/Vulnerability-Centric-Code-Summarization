# Vulnerability Centric Code Summarization
Duration: Aug 2022 - Nov 2022

## Overview
The primary objective of this project is to determine if a text/code snippet found online poses a hazard to a system. This 
is a critical issue to recognize and prevent such vulnerabilities. This study tackles that challenge by using NLP approach 
for text summarization. By checking the presence of vulnerability centric keywords or its alignement with them in the summary, 
we can get an idea if the code is a threat or not.

## Project Details
Methodology:
We choose the dataset of Stackoverflow with these domains:
- Security
- Software Engineering
- Reverse Engineering
- Stack Overflow

In the dataset, we chose combination of posts and answers. We extract the code snippets from the posts, and match them with the answers, to create a summary using the T5 model. Then using the summary, we use Natural Language Inference to determine if the summary (hypothesis) with the answer/code (premise). Then we categorize - logically follow (entailment) or unfollow (contradiction) or are undetermined (neutral). If its entailment, then the summary matches with the code. 

Then we use the summary and vulnerability metrics to calculate the scores such as a Rouge-1, Rouge-2, and Rouge-l.
