# Vulnerability Centric Code Summarization
Duration: Aug 2022 - Nov 2022

## Overview
The primary objective of this project is to determine if a text/code snippet found online poses a hazard to a system. This 
is a critical issue to recognize and prevent such vulnerabilities. This study tackles that challenge by using NLP approach 
for text summarization. By checking the presence of vulnerability centric keywords in the summary, we can get an idea if the
code is a threat or not.
